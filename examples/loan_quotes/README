SUMMARY:
========================================================================
Distributor ID:	Ubuntu
Description:	Ubuntu 14.10
Release:	14.10
Codename:	utopic
Python:         2.7.8

My though was that the functionality can be used by a real time system
which will be having a heap containing lender's offers and once a user
is asking for a quote, it will be removing the offers that are needed
from thea heap giving some time for the user to respond while in the same
time it continues to serve other quote requests. If a quote is not utilized
the offers can be back in the heap.

I made the assumption that if a user loans i.e £1000 and there is a request
for £500 by someone, then the systems lets the lender to loan that amount
and keep the other £500 for future quotes.


HOW TO USE:
========================================================================
% ./quote.py market.csv 1000
Requested amount: £1000
Rate: 7.0%
Monthly repayment: £30.88
Total repayment: £1111.68

% ./quote.py market.csv 100
Invalid loan amount request
USAGE: <exe> <lenders file> <load amount>

% ./quote.py market.csv 15000
Unable to provide a quote - Request amount bigger than total offers
